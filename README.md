# planner-app
Planner/Scheduler App

I created a new repository named planner-app.

The planner app is built with html, CSS and javaScript files.

Created an event listener for save button.

Displayed the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner with dayjs function.

Showcased timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

Color-coded each timeblock based on past, present, and future timing for when the timeblock is viewed.

Created for loop for getItem to persist events between refreshes of a page.
